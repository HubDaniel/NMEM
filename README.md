https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04140

"A_main_simulation.R" is the main code for the independent random error case. The results of NMEM in table 3, figure 3 and figure 4 are from here. Please contact Lu and Song to get the code used for Lu and Song's method in table 3, figure 3 and 4.

"A_main_simulation_CAR1.R" is the main code for the CAR1 random error case. This code is used for checking independence of random errors in section 3.
